# TDD Implementation Plan for ruby-lsp-guesser

This file tracks the TDD implementation progress. Each test should be implemented one at a time following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

## Legend
- [ ] Not implemented
- [x] Completed
- [~] In progress

## Test Plan

### Basic Setup
- [x] test_that_it_has_a_version_number - Verify version constant exists

### Core Functionality
<!-- Add tests here as features are defined -->
<!-- Example:
- [ ] test_guesser_initializes_with_default_options
- [ ] test_guesser_accepts_custom_configuration
-->

## Notes
- Update this file as new features are planned
- Mark tests with [~] when starting implementation (Red phase)
- Mark tests with [x] when implementation passes (Green phase)
- Use `/go` command to automatically find and implement the next unmarked test
